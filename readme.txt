A very simple podcast plugin.

It creates a custom post type, Podcasts, and a custom taxonomy, Podcast Program, to allow to create multiple podcasts
feeds into the same WordPress install: each term of the custom taxonomy will get its own podcast feed.

=== Dependencies ===

XV Podcasts uses Timber Library to render the feed, and Advanced Custom Fields (Pro) to ease authoring.
Those have to be installed independently
